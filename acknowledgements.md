So what really happened is I attempted to merge two totally unrelated things together: a webcomic you might've probably know named _["Homestuck"](http://homestuck.com)_ made by a totally radical dude named _Andrew Hussie_ (plus a few contributors, which I didn't care to mention all of them), with an incremental game that has a lot of prestige layer, all of which arranged into a tree, hence the name _["The Prestige Tree"](https://jacorb90.github.io/Prestige-Tree)_ made by a person with a screen name _Jacorb_ (again, plus a few contributors, which I didn't want to list all of them here). To make this thing easier, I also use what is believed to be a modification of the game (_The Prestige Tree_, not _Homestuck_) called _["The Modding Tree"](https://github.com/Acamaeda/The-Modding-Tree)_ made by _Acamaeda_ (yes, I'm talking about the same Acamaeda who made interactive Flash animations for the fanmade continuation of Homestuck: _Homestuck: Act Omega_, coincidence?) which wraps the game into a framework that can be easily changed and modified. Anyways, the game might not be reflexing the true aspects of _Homestuck_ or _The Prestige Tree_, simply because making fan content that is actually two things merged together while maintaining their original aspect is a hard thing to do. Also, while I'm trying to do exactly what I just said earlier, I've also used some external resources to save time:

- **The icons for the aspect layers:** I stripped those from The Extended Zodiac website. You can find it [here](http://hs.hiveswap.com/ezodiac/aboutaspects.php).
- **The troll language:** As you may or may not know, _Homestuck_ has it's own alphabet system, although saying "has" is a little bit too much because it's literally just Elder Scrolls' Daedric language rotated 180 degrees. So what I did is download the _["Dongle's Oblivion Daedric font set"](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/File:Obliviontt.zip)_, used it in the project (the page said I'm free to do something with it anyways), then used CSS magic to rotate the text 180 degrees so it becames the Alternian language you may or may not love.

Also, in case you're wondering why am I doing this, considering half of the people actively talk in the Discord server know what _Homestuck_ is, I'd say _why the hell not lol?_.
