                You've just finally did it!
                <br/><br/>
                You've spent your last ${formatWhole(player.timePlayed / 86400)} days playing that one game about Homestuck and
                prestige trees and you've beaten it! Now you don't need to play that monstrosity of a game anymore! Like it's
                even Homestuck related, where is my Jonh Ebgrte!?? Where is Act 1?? Why is it using like 90% of my computer's
                power usage? Did the developer add a bitcoin miner in this game? Or is this bad optimizing? You have so many
                questions about this game, so much that you know telling all of them here will be a waste of time for everyone.
                <br/><br/>
                You're just so excited about this. Might as well try to remake the Homestuck intro just to celebrate your freedom
                from that game. You don't know why, but you just feel like it. Oh, it's April 13th. That explains why.
