		End of Act 0?<br>
		This game is definitely very broken by now<br>
		(If you see a bug in the <spoiler>Meta</spoiler> layer, it is probably intentional)<br>
		<spoiler>(I'm definitely going to question my design decisions now)</spoiler><br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.8.6.1</h3><br>
		Fixed <spoiler>Sacrifice Milestones</spoiler> unlocking earlier than intended.<br>
	<br>

		Added 1 new layer.<br>
		Added... a few more things.<br>
		Migrated to The Modding Tree 2.π.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.7.1</h3><br>
		Added <spoiler>Compact Mode for Sign Viewers</spoiler>.<br>
    <br>
	<h2>v0.0.3.7</h2><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- End of Act 0? -</h5>
		The game now has a definitive "end", or does it?<br>
		More <spoiler>Skaia upgrades</spoiler> becuase why not?<br>
		Even more massive slowdowns.<br>
		Even more bugs.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.6.1 ~ v0.0.3.6.4</h3><br>
		Miscellaneous bug fixes that I don't even know what they are anymore.<br>
    <br>
	<h2>v0.0.3.6</h2><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- Massive Slowdown -</h5>
		Added two new layers, each has over 144(!) new things that you can buy. Gosh that will be very laggy.<br>
		More <spoiler>Skaia upgrades</spoiler> becuase why not?<br>
		Decided not to bump the endgame because I accidently bumped it too much. Content should span until you get your first <spoiler>Gold sign</spoiler> in the new two layers.<br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5"><br/><spoiler>(also the title of the new 244 "things" might not be trully accurate to their actual Homestuck-canony-thingy names so i guess you can report it to me if you want to fix something idk oh well)</spoiler></h5>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.5</h3><br>
		Added more <spoiler>Skaia upgrades</spoiler>.<br>
		Bumped endgame to ee16,000,000 (note: the <spoiler>Unlock Prospit/Derse</spoiler> upgrades currently does nothing).<br>
		Note: your <spoiler>Aspect and Class layers</spoiler> will be reset if you have more than ee100,000 points due to inflation. You still have your ee100,000 points though, so climbing back shouldn't be a problem.<br>
    <br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.4</h3><br>
		Rebalanced the <spoiler>Class Points</spoiler> section.<br>
		Bumped the endgame requrements to ee81,000 points.<br>

		Fixed having two <spoiler>Muse Powers</spoiler>.<br>
		Used <span style="font-family:'Courier Prime', monospace">Courier Prime</span> as a fallback font if you somehow don't have Courier New installed on your device.<br>
    <br>
	<h2>v0.0.3.2</h3><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- I was right -</h5>
		One new layer. Updated metadata. <spoiler>Skaia</spoiler> upgrades. Bumped endgame to ee51,000 points.<br>
		Note: This update changed the internal for the <spoiler>meta aspect layer</spoiler> to make more consistency with the other <spoiler>meta layers</spoiler>, that means it has to be reseted. You should be able to climb back to where you originally was quick.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.3.1</h3><br>
		Reduced the requirements for the meta layer.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>v0.0.3</h2><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- Another update yay -</h5>
		Added a meta aspect layer that mock-ups the previous twelves. You can access it when you completed all of the 12 aspect layers mentioned earlier.<br>
		(also updated the modfinder to give it a new look. And yes, they are in the same repsitory so...)<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.2.5</h3><br>
		Adjusted the progress text.<br>
		Fixed <spoiler>Life Power</spoiler> going below zero anymore (for real this time).<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.2.4</h3><br>
		Added a text that says how many layers there are left to unlock in the current act or until current endgame, or the current goal/endgame if there is none remaining.<br>
		<spoiler>Life Power</spoiler> should no longer be able to go below zero anymore. This fixes some softlocks and NaN bugs.<br>
		Fixed the <spoiler>BEGIN THE PLAN.</spoiler> upgrade being buyable before 22 <spoiler>Skaia levels</spoiler> despite being grayed out.<br>
		Fixed the 20 <spoiler>Void Points</spoiler> milestone having the effect of the 1,000 <spoiler>Void Points</spoiler> milestone.<br>
		Fixed the text of some places.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.2.3</h3><br>
		Actually updated the endgame popup (finally).<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.2.2</h3><br>
		Added a system that detects inconsistant version to prevent errors (kind of).<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v0.0.2.1</h3><br>
		Fixed some bugs, here and there.<br>
		Dropped the alpha thingy. This game is still in the development stage, it's just me wanting a shorter version name.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>v0.0.2</h2><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- This is stupid^2 -</h5>
		Added six more aspect layers. SIX OF THEM.<br>
		Rebalanced <spoiler>Rage Challenges</spoiler> and added more <spoiler>Hope Upgrades</spoiler>.<br>
		Added a tip in the Time layer that you can hold T to temporarily automate absorbing Time Power.<br>
		Added an order of magnitude per second display for large numbers.<br>
		Fixed some bugs, here and there.<br>
		Also added random title text in the info tab.<br>

		Also added some metadata.<br>
		Also added a favicon.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>v0.0.1</h2><br>
		<h5 style="opacity:0.5">- This is stupid -</h5>
		The beginning. Nothing is really changed at this point because this is the first version... <i>ever.</i><br>
	<br>
	<h5 style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS',cursive;font-size:10px;color:#f400ec">honestly i want to add a sbahj theme but the current theme api is too strict for that<br/>oh well</h5>
